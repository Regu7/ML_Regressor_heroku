# ML_Regressor_heroku

I have build ML Regressoion model that predicts the weight of the fish based on the fish's weight, height, species and length.

I have created a Web app using Flask and deployed it in Heroku

To run the app, first install the requirements file using the command below

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Next, run the app using

`python app.py`
